## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in **Macroecology** at the **Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences**, and currently a visiting student in the ECONOVO, Aarhus University.

I received my Research Master’s degree in **Ecology, Evolution & Conservation** from **Imperial College London**, and my Bachelor’s degree in **Ecology** from **Sun Yat-Sen University**.

My research investigates how species functional traits contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity across biogeographic contexts. I quantify patterns of functional diversity, trait variation, and inter- and intra-specific trait relationships along ecological gradients, and between native and exotic species. My work integrates trait-based theory with biogeography to inform community construction and biodiversity conservation.
