## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in **Macroecology** at the **Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences**.

My research focuses on the macroecology of **frugivory and seed dispersal**, with a particular interest in **trait matching between frugivores and fleshy-fruited plants** and how these trait relationships influence **seed dispersal effectiveness and large-scale biodiversity patterns**. By integrating species traits, interaction networks, and biogeographic data, I aim to understand how biotic interactions vary across latitude, insularity, and environmental gradients.

I received my Research Master’s degree in **Ecology, Evolution & Conservation** from **Imperial College London**, and my Bachelor’s degree in **Ecology** from **Sun Yat-Sen University**.

My work combines **global datasets**, **network-based analyses**, and **statistical modelling** to address fundamental questions in plant–animal interactions and macroecology, with implications for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functioning.
