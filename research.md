## Latitudinal patterns of seed defences and nutrition
**2022 – present**

I investigate geographic patterns of seed defensive and nutritional traits across latitude by intensively collecting seeds from more than **30 natural forest communities** spanning **18.68°N to 52.36°N**. This project aims to reveal how seed traits vary geographically and how they are shaped by biotic pressures and climatic factors.

## Global biogeography of trait matching in plant–frugivore networks
**2022 – 2024**

By compiling a global dataset of **354 avian frugivory networks** (22,199 interactions involving 1,247 bird species and 2,126 plant species), this project provides the first global assessment of **trait matching**—a proxy for interaction strength—across latitude and insularity.

## When utilization and invasion meet across the global spectrum of plant form and function
**2021 – 2022**

Using data from **24,110 utilised and/or invasive plant species**, this study examined how human utilisation and biological invasion jointly shape plant functional diversity. We found that utilised species tend to be large-sized, while invasive species are generally small, and that utilisation expands the functional space occupied by invasive species.

## Global impacts of land-use change on functional diversity of invertivorous birds
**2020 – 2021**

Based on the **PREDICTS database**, this project assessed how land-use change influences the functional diversity of invertivorous bird assemblages worldwide.
